*   Lambda Expressions, a new language feature, has been introduced in this release. They enable you to treat functionality as a method argument, or code as data. Lambda expressions let you express instances of single-method interfaces (referred to as functional interfaces) more compactly.
*   Method references provide easy-to-read lambda expressions for methods that already have a name.
*   Default methods enable new functionality to be added to the interfaces of libraries and ensure binary compatibility with code written for older versions of those interfaces
*   Classes in the new java.util.stream package provides a Stream API to support functional-style operations on streams of elements. The Stream API is integrated into the Collections API, which enables bulk operations on collections, such as sequential or parallel map-reduce transformations.
*   Classes and interfaces have been added to the java.util.concurrent package.
*   Methods have been added to the java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap class to support aggregate operations based on the newly added streams facility and lambda expressions.
*   Classes have been added to the java.util.concurrent.atomic package to support scalable updatable variables.
*   Methods have been added to the java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool class to support a common pool.
*   The java.util.concurrent.locks.StampedLock class has been added to provide a capability-based lock with three modes for controlling read/write access.
